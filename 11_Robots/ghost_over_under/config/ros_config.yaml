      # These calculate odometry standard deviations. X is forward, Y is left on robot.
      # Primary components are k1, k5, k9, which relate x travel to x error, y travel to y error, theta -> theta error.
      
      # Other values couple unrelated motions. These should be much smaller (and remember to account for units!)
      # EX. Y error from X Motion should be very small, but maybe the robot drifts slightly sideways as it tries to drive straight.

      # Remember that LIDAR will correct periodically, so these can be a bit generous.
      # Too generous though, and you are either losing resolution or wasting computation.
